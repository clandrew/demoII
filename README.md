## What is it?
It is definitely a computer program. A program that runs on the computer. Specifically an Apple II computer. A bunch of ones and zeroes. You could think of it as a port of Crysis for the Apple II computer family.

## Build
This is assembled using Merlin Pro assembler version 2.43. The source is all in one file, T.GR.asm.

On a serious note, this was borne out of a personal desire to learn more about programming 6502-on-Apple II. Ages ago I wrote Logo and Basic code for that platform but never in 6502 directly. This was made in a few days and tested using an emulator. I gave my disk image to a friend to run on real hardware. I expected this would shake out some inconsistencies between running on hardware and running on emulator, but it worked as expected the first time.

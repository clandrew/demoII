 We're no strangers to love			Astley dancing
 you know the rules and so do i			copy paste
 
 A full committment's what I'm dreaming of	Tunnel scrolling up
 You wouldn't get this from any other guy	into the stars
 
 I just wanna tell you how i'm feeling		Cassette tape being loaded into a tape player
 Gotta make you understand			Loaded
 
 Never gonna give you up			Fancy text
 Never gonna let you down			Fireworks
 Never gonna run around and desert you		Astley dancing
 
 Never gonna make you cry			Pointing blond guy dance at 2:25 in music video
 Never gonna say goodbye
 Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you		Astley at 0:46
 
 Never gonna tell a lie--			Fin
